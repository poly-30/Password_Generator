![Framework: Flutter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Framework-Flutter-blue.svg)

A simple, secure, and cross-platform password generator application built with Flutter.

## 📖 Description
This is a user-friendly tool for creating strong, random passwords. The app provides a clean interface for customizing password criteria, including length and character types. It was built using the Flutter framework, allowing it to run on Android, iOS, and the web from a single codebase.

## ✨ Features
-   **Adjustable Length**: Easily set the password length using a slider (from 4 to 32 characters).
-   **Character Types**: Choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
-   **Secure Generation**: Uses Dart's `Random.secure()` for cryptographically strong random values.
-   **Strength Indicator**: Visual feedback on the generated password's strength (Weak, Medium, Strong, Very Strong).
-   **Copy to Clipboard**: Instantly copy the generated password with a single tap.
